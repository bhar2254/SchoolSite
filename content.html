	<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
	<p>I'm a dual Math/Physics major currently studing as a freshman at Truman.</p>
	<p>I am currently taking:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Analytical Geometry and Calculus II</li>
		<li>Physics I w/ Lab</li>
		<li>Elementary French I</li>
		<li>Freshman Seminar</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I'm personally quite fond of my classes and would definitely taking physics 195 (Physics I w/ Calculus) to any student looking to take a physics class. It may be difficult, but to me it seems worth the effort</p>

	<h3>Here are some of my favorite places on campus</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Centennial Hall Piano</li>
		<li>SUB Hub</li>
		<li>The Quad on a oood day</li>
	</ol>
	<p>These aren't all the great places on campus, but are a few I found exceptionally noteworthy</p>
